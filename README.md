# sifdm-data-interpretations
Interpretations and visuals extracted from SIFDM simulations by @PMocz.

Running axionDarkMatter_SI.m from @PMocz with different parameters yields simulations of idealized self-interacting "fuzzy" dark matter halos.
The purpose of this repository is to provide code that takes those simulations as input and provides a number of versatile methods for extracting, analyzing, and visualizing the output.
